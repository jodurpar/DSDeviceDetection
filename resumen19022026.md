## Project: DsDeviceDetection v2 (Remastered)

Today, we successfully completed the full remastering of the **DsDeviceDetection** microservice, transforming a legacy project into a modern, high-performance, and standalone senior-level microservice.

### 1. Core Architecture Re-engineering
- **Design Patterns**: Implemented **Strategy Pattern** for detectors and **Chain of Responsibility** for the detection coordinator.
- **Data-Driven Design**: Decoupled detection logic from code. All browser, OS, and device patterns are now loaded from a central `signatures.json` file.
- **Improved Detection**: 
    - Added support for **Client Hints** (`Sec-CH-UA-*`) for high precision in modern browsers.
    - Added browser **engine** detection (Blink, WebKit, Gecko).
    - Implemented smart heuristics for extracting mobile brand and model directly from User-Agent strings.

### 2. Technological Modernization
- **Stack**: Upgraded to **Node.js 22 LTS**, **TypeScript 5**, and native **ESM**.
- **Web Framework**: Migrated to **Express.js** for a more flexible and standard routing system.
- **Validation**: Strict typing with TypeScript interfaces for reliable detection results.

### 3. Interface & Documentation
- **Web UI**: Developed a premium minimalist dashboard with **Glassmorphism** and **Dark Mode** for manual testing.
- **API Documentation**: Integrated **OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger UI)** at `/docs` with a fully documented schema and "Try it out" functionality.
- **Globalization**: Translated all UI components, API documentation, and code comments into **English**.

### 4. DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Created an optimized **multi-stage Dockerfile** using Alpine Linux for small and secure images.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestration ready for immediate local deployment.
- **Docker Hub**: Published the official image to **`jodurpar/dsdevicedetection:latest`**.

### 5. Governance & Repository Quality
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation suite in English: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (including DCO), `TestMe.md`, `changelog.md`, and `NOTICE.md`.
- **Git Strategy**: 
    - Merged all modernization work into the primary branch.
    - Renamed the default branch to **`main`**.
    - Pushed all history to the official GitHub repository.
- **Cleanup**: Removed legacy files including `.sln`, obsolete screenshots, and deprecated logic to ensure a 100% consistent repository.
- **Environment**: Modernized `.vscode` settings for a better developer experience (Debugger, Vitest support, Auto-formatting).

**The project is now stable, professional, and ready for production use or community contribution.**
