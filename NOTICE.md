**DsDeviceDetection Microservice**

Copyright (c) 2026 José Durán Pareja.

## Attribution
This microservice was designed and developed by José Durán Pareja (jodurpar) in 2019, and was fully remastered in 2026 to comply with modern software architecture standards.

## Data Disclaimer
This software uses a detection engine based on patterns (Regex/JSON) and heuristics for the identification of User-Agents and Client Hints.

1.  **Accuracy**: The accuracy of device, operating system, and browser detection depends exclusively on the currency and accuracy of the signatures contained in `/data/signatures.json`.
2.  **Community Maintenance**: Since hardware manufacturers and software developers constantly release new user agents, this software relies on community contributions to stay up to date.
3.  **Warranty**: The software is provided "as is", without warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding its technical accuracy or fitness for a particular purpose. José Durán Pareja is not responsible for the consequences derived from incorrect detections or the lack of support for specific devices in critical or contractual applications.
